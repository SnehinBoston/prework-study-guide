# prework-study-guide

## Description

The motivation to create the project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I built the project to learn the basic tags in HTML, styling attributes in CSS, variables and functions in JavaScript and Git commands. This project provided a study guide to refer to learn the basics of above languages. I learnt how to create a basic webpage and put some styling in it.
